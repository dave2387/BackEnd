// 10 - Json File : 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy 
for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
It is often used for transmitting data in web applications between a server and a client.

Data Representation: JSON represents data as name/value pairs, similar to how objects 
are represented in JavaScript. Each name is followed by a colon and the value, and pairs 
are separated by commas.
 
For example:

{
    "firstName": "Dhruv",
    "lastName": "Dave"
}
